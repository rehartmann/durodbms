Installation procedure for DuroDBMS
===================================

DuroDBMS uses SCons to build itself. Type:

scons
scons jni	(optional, builds the Java interface)
scons tcl	(optional, builds the Tcl interface)
scons test	(optional, runs the tests)
scons install

To build DuroDBMS with PostgreSQL support, add postgresql=true to each invocation.

'scons test' will build the Tcl interface if it has not already been built
because the tests depend on it. If Tcl is not available, running the tests
will not be possible. Duroadmin will not be available either.

SCons is available from www.scons.org.

To compile DuroDBMS, you need GNU Libtool and Berkeley DB (6.1 recommended).

Building the Java interface requires Java Development Kit 8. 

Building the Tcl interface requires Tcl (8.1 or later).

'scons test' requires the Tcl interface and the tcltest package.

On Unix-like systems, Berkeley DB is assumed to be located in
/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.6.1. If Berkeley DB is located in a different directory,
you can pass this directory to SCons using the bdbhome variable, so
if Berkeley DB is located in /usr instead of /usr/local, you may use:

scons bdbhome=/usr/BerkeleyDB.6.1

The location of Berkeley DB may also be specified using
the environment. With Visual C++, the variables LIB and INCLUDE
can be used.

By default, DuroDBMS is installed in C:\duro.1.3 on Windows, and
/usr/local/duro.1.3 on all other systems.
You can specify a different directory by passing an installdir
variable to scons, e. g.:

scons installdir=/usr install

This will install DuroDBMS in /usr/duro.1.3.

To build the REST server, type:

scons srv/durod

Building durod requires libmicrohttpd.
