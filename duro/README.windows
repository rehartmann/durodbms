	README for DuroDBMS

This file contains information on the binary Windows release of DuroDBMS, a relational
database management system.

Complete source code is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/duro.

The following software is required for running this version of DuroDBMS on MS Windows:

- Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store, release 18.1
- Tcl 8.6 (optional)

Add the directories where the respective DLLs are located to PATH,
together with the 'bin' subdirectory of the DuroDBMS root directory.

To learn about how to use DuroDBMS, see the documentation in the 'docs'
subdirectory. Example code can be found in the 'tests' subdirectory
of the source release.

The Java interface requires Java Development Kit 7 or later.
Add the file jduro.jar in the 'lib' subdirectory to the classpath. 

The Tcl interface can be found in the 'lib' subdirectory.
The easiest way to make it available to application
scripts is to add this subdirectory to TCLLIBPATH, e.g.:

    set TCLLIBPATH=C:/durodbms.1.7/lib

DuroDBMS is still under development. Report bugs to
rhartmann@users.sourceforge.net.
